HTML Images Syntax
In HTML, images are defined with the <img> tag.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:

<img src="url" alt="some_text" style="width:width;height:height;">


The alt Attribute
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

If a browser cannot find an image, it will display the value of the alt attribute:


The alt attribute is required. A web page will not validate correctly without it.


HTML Screen Readers
A screen reader is a software program that reads the HTML code, converts the text, and allows the user to "listen" to the content. Screen readers are useful for people who are blind, visually impaired, or learning disabled.

Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

The values are specified in pixels (use px after the value):




Alternatively, you can use the width and height attributes. Here, the values are specified in pixels by default:

Example
<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">

Note: Always specify the width and height of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page will flicker while the image loads.

Width and Height, or Style?
Both the width, height, and style attributes are valid in HTML5.

However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents internal or external styles sheets from changing the original size of images:




Images in Another Folder
If not specified, the browser expects to find the image in the same folder as the web page.

However, it is common to store images in a sub-folder. You must then include the folder name in the src attribute:

Example
<img src="/images/html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">





Images on Another Server
Some web sites store their images on image servers.

Actually, you can access images from any web address in the world:

Example
<img src="http://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com">




Animated Images
The GIF standard allows animated images:

Example
<img src="programming.gif" alt="Computer Man" style="width:48px;height:48px;">
Note that the syntax of inserting animated images is no different from non-animated images.





Using an Image as a Link
 To use an image as a link, simply nest the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
  <img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;border:0;">
</a>






Image Floating
Use the CSS float property to let the image float to the right or to the left of a text:

Example
<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the right of the text.</p>

<p><img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:left;width:42px;height:42px;">
The image will float to the left of the text.</p>






Image Maps
Use the <map> tag to define an image-map. An image-map is an image with clickable areas.

The name attribute of the <map> tag is associated with the <img>'s usemap attribute and creates a relationship between the image and the map.

The <map> tag contains a number of <area> tags, that defines the clickable areas in the image-map:
